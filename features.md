Here are features that would genuinely differentiate MarkLiveEdit    
  from the sea of markdown editors:                                    
                                                                       
  High Impact, Low Effort:                                             
  1. Syntax highlighting in the editor — color markdown syntax         
  (headings, bold, links) in the textarea using a code mirror overlay  
  or a contenteditable approach                                        
  2. Theme toggle — light/dark mode switch; many users prefer light for
   writing
  3. Markdown cheat sheet panel — a slide-out reference panel for quick
   syntax lookup
  4. Shareable links — encode markdown into a URL hash so users can
  share documents without a backend
  5. Paste image support — paste screenshots from clipboard, convert to
   base64 inline

  Medium Effort, Strong Differentiation:
  6. Multiple document tabs — work on several files at once, all saved
  to localStorage
  7. Focus/zen mode — hide preview, toolbar, chrome; just the editor
  fullscreen with a word count
  8. Find & replace — Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H within the editor
  9. Auto-pairing — auto-close **, `, [], () when typing
  10. Table of contents — auto-generated from headings in a collapsible
   sidebar
  11. Code syntax highlighting in preview — use Prism.js or
  Highlight.js for fenced code blocks

  High Effort, Premium Feel:
  12. Collaborative editing — real-time via WebRTC (no server needed)
  13. Vim/Emacs keybindings — toggle for power users
  14. Mermaid diagram support — render flowcharts and sequence diagrams
   from markdown
  15. Presentation mode — split markdown by --- and present as slides
  16. Version history — save snapshots in localStorage, diff and
  restore
